## Usage

---

Please follow the steps outlined below for how to use the command-line application once all of the necessary programs and npm packages are installed:

1. To begin using the application, run "node index.js" in the command line. This will tell Node.js runtime to read the index.js file's code and execute it.

2. You will have the ability to view and interact with information stored in the employee database. You can select any of the "View" prompts in the list to look at data in the employee, role, and department tables. You can select any of the "Add" or "Update" prompts to add or update information in the tables about an employee, role, or department. 

3. If you choose to add or update information, you can then "View" that table to see what changes you have made!
